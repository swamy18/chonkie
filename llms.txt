## 🦛 Chonkie Docs 📚

</div>

> "Ugh, writing docs is such a pain — I'm going to make chonkie so simple that people will just get it!"
> — @chonknick, probably

Unfortunately, we do need docs for Chonkie (we tried!). While official docs are available at [docs.chonkie.ai](https://docs.chonkie.ai), these docs are meant as an additional resource to help you get the most out of Chonkie. Since these docs live inside the repo, they are a bit more flexible and can be updated more frequently, and are also a bit more detailed. Furthermore, they are easy to edit with AI, so you can ask the AI to update them with examples, recipes, and more! (Haha, less work for the maintainers! 🤖)

> [!NOTE]
> Since these docs are a single markdown file, they make it ultra-simple to add into your LLM of choice to answer questions about Chonkie! Cool, huh? Yeah, Chonkie is super cool. 🦛✨

## 📦 Installation

Chonkie is available for direct installation from PyPI, via the following command:

```bash
pip install chonkie
```

We believe in the rule of **minimum default dependencies** and **Make-Your-Own-Package (MYOP)** principles, so Chonkie has a bunch of optional dependencies that you can configure to get the most out of your Chonkie experience. Though, we do realize that it might be a pain to configure, so you can just install it all with the following command:

```bash
pip install "chonkie[all]"
```

We detail the optional dependencies below.

### Optional Dependencies

## Usage

Chonkie is designed to be ultra-simple to use. There are usually always 3 steps: Install, Import, and CHONK! We'll go over a simple example below.


First, let's install Chonkie. We only need the base package since we'll be using the `RecursiveChunker` for this example

```bash
pip install chonkie
```

Next, we'll import Chonkie and create a `Chonkie` object.
```python
from chonkie import RecursiveChunker

chunker = RecursiveChunker()
```

Now, we'll use the `chunk` method to chunk some text.

```python
text = "Hello, world!"
chunks = chunker(text)
```

And that's it! We've just chonked some text. The `chunks` object is a list of `Chunk` objects. We can print them out to see what we've got.

```python
# Print out the chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(chunk.token_count)
    print(chunk.start_index)
    print(chunk.end_index)
```

## Types and Data Structures

### The `Chunk` Type

All chunkers in Chonkie now return the base `Chunk` type for consistency and simplicity. The `Chunk` type is a dataclass with the following attributes:

```python
@dataclass
class Chunk:
    text: str                                        # The text content of the chunk
    start_index: int                                 # Starting position in original text
    end_index: int                                   # Ending position in original text
    token_count: int                                 # Number of tokens in the chunk
    context: Optional[Context] = None               # Optional context metadata
    embedding: Union[list[float], "np.ndarray", None] = None  # Optional embedding vector (list or numpy array)
```

The `embedding` attribute can store embedding vectors (as lists or numpy arrays) which are automatically added when using `EmbeddingsRefinery` or certain chunkers like `LateChunker`.

### The `Sentence` Type

The `Sentence` type is used internally by sentence-based chunkers and represents individual sentences with metadata:

```python
@dataclass
class Sentence:
    text: str                                        # The sentence text
    start_index: int                                 # Starting position in original text
    end_index: int                                   # Ending position in original text
    token_count: int                                 # Number of tokens in the sentence
    embedding: Union[list[float], "np.ndarray", None] = None  # Optional embedding vector
```

> [!NOTE]
> As of version 1.3.0, all specialized types have been simplified. The specialized chunk types (`SentenceChunk`, `RecursiveChunk`, `SemanticChunk`, `CodeChunk`, and `LateChunk`) have been removed - all chunkers now return the base `Chunk` type. Similarly, `SemanticSentence` has been removed as the base `Sentence` type now includes an optional `embedding` field. This simplifies the API and makes it easier to chain different components together.

## CHONKosophy

Chonkie truly believes that chunking should be simple to understand, easy to use and performant where it matters. It is fundamental to Chonkie's design principles. We truly believe that chunking should never be brought into the foreground of your codebase, and should be a primitive that you don't even think about. Just like how we don't think about the `for` loop or the `if` statement at the assembly level (sorry assembly devs 🤖).


### How does Chonkie think about chunking?

In Chonkie, we think of chunking as a pipeline, not just a single operation. Generally, the pipeline looks like this:

`Input Data -> Chef -> Chunker(s) -> Refinery(s) -> Porter/Handshake`

The `Chef` is responsible for fetching the data, cleaning it, and preparing it for chunking. The `Chunker` is responsible for chunking the data. The `Refinery` is responsible for refining the chunks, and the `Porter` and `Handshake` are responsible for the final step of the pipeline, which is to return the chunks in a format that can be used by the user or to upsert into a database.


## Chunkers 

Chunkers are the core of Chonkie. They are responsible for chunking the text into smaller, more manageable pieces. There are many different types of chunkers, each with their own unique properties and use cases. We'll go over the different types of chunkers below.

### `TokenChunker`

The `TokenChunker` is the most basic type of chunker. It simply splits the text into chunks of a given token length. It comes with the default installation of Chonkie.

**Parameters:**

- `tokenizer (Union[str, Any])`: The tokenizer to use. Defaults to `character` tokenizer. You can also pass `word` to use the word tokenizer, or any string identifier like `gpt2` to use the `tokenizers.Tokenizer` library. More details mentioned in the [Tokenizers](#tokenizers) section.
- `chunk_size (int)`: The number of tokens to chunk the text into. Defaults to `512`.
- `overlap (int)`: The number of tokens to overlap between chunks. Defaults to `0`.

**Methods:**

- `chunk(text: str) -> list[Chunk]`: Chunks a string into a list of `Chunk` objects.
- `chunk_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[Chunk]]`: Chunks a list of strings into a list of lists of `Chunk` objects.
- `__call__(text: str) -> Union[list[Chunk], list[list[Chunk]]]`: Chunks a string or list of strings into chunk objects.

**Examples:**

Here are a couple of examples on how to use the `TokenChunker` in practice.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Usage of `TokenChunker`</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker

chunker = TokenChunker()
chunks = chunker("Hello, world!")

# Print out the chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(chunk.token_count)
    print(chunk.start_index)
    print(chunk.end_index)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Using `TokenChunker` with a custom tokenizer</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker

chunker = TokenChunker(tokenizer="gpt2")  # Or use default: TokenChunker()
chunks = chunker("Hello, world!")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Chunking a batch of text</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker

batch = [
    "Hello, world!",
    "This is a test",
    "Chunking is fun!"
]

chunker = TokenChunker()
chunks = chunker.chunk_batch(batch)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Visualizing the chunks with `Visualizer`</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker, Visualizer

chunker = TokenChunker()
chunks = chunker("Hello, world!")

viz = Visualizer()
viz(chunks)
```

</details>

### `SentenceChunker`

The `SentenceChunker` is a chunker that splits the text into sentences and then groups the sentences together into chunks based on a given `chunk_size`, where `chunk_size` is the maximum tokens a chunk can have. Given that it groups naturally occurring sentence together, it's `token_count` value is not as consistent as the `TokenChunker`. However, it makes an excellent choice for chunking well formatted text, being both simple and fast.

**Parameters:**

- `tokenizer_or_token_counter (Union[str, Callable, Any])`: The tokenizer or token counter to use. Defaults to `gpt2` with `tokenizers.Tokenizer`. You can also pass `character` or `word` to use the character or word tokenizer respectively. Additionally, you can also pass a `Callable` that takes in a string and returns the number of tokens in the string. More details mentioned in the [Tokenizers](#tokenizers) section.
- `chunk_size (int)`: The maximum number of tokens a chunk can have. Defaults to `512`.
- `chunk_overlap (int)`: The number of tokens to overlap between chunks. Defaults to `0`.
- `min_sentences_per_chunk (int)`: Minimum number of sentences per chunk. Defaults to `1`.
- `min_characters_per_sentence (int)`: Minimum number of characters per sentence. Defaults to `12`.
- `approximate (bool)`: [DEPRECATED] Whether to use approximate token counting. Defaults to `False`.
- `delim (Union[str, list[str]])`: Delimiters to split sentences on. Defaults to `[". ", "! ", "? ", "\n"]`.
- `include_delim (Optional[Literal["prev", "next"]])`: Whether to include delimiters in the current chunk (`"prev"`), the next chunk (`"next"`), or not at all (`None`). Defaults to `"prev"`.

**Methods:**

- `chunk(text: str) -> list[Chunk]`: Chunks a string into a list of `Chunk` objects. Returns the base `Chunk` type.
- `chunk_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[Chunk]]`: Chunks a list of strings into a list of lists of `Chunk` objects. (Inherited)
- `from_recipe(name: str, lang: str, **kwargs) -> SentenceChunker`: Creates a `SentenceChunker` instance using pre-defined recipes from the [Chonkie Recipe Store](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chonkie-ai/recipes). This allows easy configuration for specific languages or splitting behaviors.
- `__call__(text: str) -> Union[list[Chunk], list[list[Chunk]]]`: Chunks a string or list of strings. Calls `chunk` or `chunk_batch` depending on input type. (Inherited)

**Examples:**

Here are a couple of examples on how to use the `SentenceChunker` in practice.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Usage of `SentenceChunker`</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import SentenceChunker

# Initialize with default settings (character tokenizer, chunk_size 512)
chunker = SentenceChunker()

text = "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence, which is a bit longer. And finally, the third sentence!"
chunks = chunker(text)

# Print out the chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Text: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Token Count: {chunk.token_count}")
    print(f"Start Index: {chunk.start_index}")
    print(f"End Index: {chunk.end_index}")
    # All chunkers now return the base Chunk type for consistency
    print("-" * 10)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Using `SentenceChunker` with custom delimiters and smaller chunk size</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import SentenceChunker

# Use custom delimiters and a smaller chunk size
chunker = SentenceChunker(
    chunk_size=20,
    delim=["\n", ". "], # Split on newlines and periods followed by space
    include_delim="next" # Include delimiter at the start of the next chunk
)

text = "Sentence one.\nSentence two.\nSentence three is very short."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n---")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Using `SentenceChunker.from_recipe`</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import SentenceChunker

# Requires "chonkie[hub]" to be installed
# Uses default recipe for English ('en')
chunker = SentenceChunker.from_recipe(lang="en", chunk_size=64)

text = "This demonstrates using a recipe. Recipes define delimiters. They make setup easy."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n---")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Visualizing the chunks with `Visualizer`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[viz]" to be installed
from chonkie import SentenceChunker, Visualizer

chunker = SentenceChunker(chunk_size=30)
text = "Chunk visualization is helpful. It shows how the text is split. Let's see how this looks."
chunks = chunker(text)

viz = Visualizer()
viz(chunks) # Prints colored output to terminal or creates HTML
```

</details>

### `RecursiveChunker`

The `RecursiveChunker` is a more complex type of chunker that uses a recursive approach to chunk the text. It is a good choice for chunking text that is not well-suited for the `TokenChunker`.

### `SemanticChunker`

The `SemanticChunker` splits text into semantically coherent chunks using sentence embeddings. It first splits the text into sentences, embeds them, and then groups sentences based on their semantic similarity. This approach aims to keep related sentences together within the same chunk, leading to more contextually meaningful chunks compared to fixed-size or simple delimiter-based methods. It's particularly useful for processing text where preserving the flow of ideas is important.

There are two main strategies for chunking:

1. **Window Strategy**: This strategy compares each sentence to the previous one (or within a small window) to determine if they are semantically similar. If they are, they are grouped together. Since it only compares a pre-defined window of sentences every time, it is easy to batch embed the (window, sentence) pairs and compare their similarity values.
2. **Cumulative Strategy**: This strategy compares each sentence to the mean embedding of the current group. If the sentence is more similar to the mean than the threshold, it is added to the group. Otherwise, a new group is started. This is much more computationally expensive than the window strategy, but can at times result in better chunks.

For both of the above strategies, in `auto` mode, we determine the `threshold` value based on a binary search over the range of values that keeps the median `chunk_size` below the `chunk_size` parameter and above the `min_chunk_size` parameter. While this may not always result in the ideal chunks, it does provide a good starting point. Hopefully, this will be improved in future versions of Chonkie.

**Parameters:**

- `embedding_model (Union[str, BaseEmbeddings])`: The embedding model to use for semantic chunking. Can be a string identifier (e.g., from Hugging Face Hub like `"minishlab/potion-base-32M"`) or an instantiated `BaseEmbeddings` object. Defaults to `"minishlab/potion-base-32M"`. Requires appropriate extras like `chonkie[semantic]` or specific model providers (`chonkie[st]`, `chonkie[openai]`, etc.).
- `mode (str)`: The strategy for comparing sentence similarity. `"window"` compares adjacent sentences (or within a small window), while `"cumulative"` compares a new sentence to the mean embedding of the current group. Defaults to `"window"`.
- `threshold (Union[str, float, int])`: The similarity threshold for splitting sentences. Can be `"auto"` (uses a binary search to find an optimal threshold based on `chunk_size`), a float between 0.0 and 1.0 (direct cosine similarity threshold), or an int between 1 and 100 (percentile threshold). Defaults to `"auto"`.
- `chunk_size (int)`: The target maximum number of tokens per chunk. Defaults to `512`.
- `similarity_window (int)`: When `mode="window"`, this defines the number of preceding sentences to consider when calculating the similarity of the current sentence. Defaults to `1`.
- `min_sentences (int)`: The minimum number of sentences allowed in a chunk. Defaults to `1`.
- `min_chunk_size (int)`: The minimum number of tokens allowed in a chunk. Also influences the minimum sentence length considered during splitting. Defaults to `2`.
- `min_characters_per_sentence (int)`: Minimum number of characters a sentence must have to be considered valid during the initial sentence splitting phase. Shorter segments might be merged. Defaults to `12`.
- `threshold_step (float)`: Step size used in the binary search when `threshold="auto"`. Defaults to `0.01`.
- `delim (Union[str, list[str]])`: Delimiters used to split the text into initial sentences. Defaults to `[". ", "! ", "? ", "\n"]`.
- `include_delim (Optional[Literal["prev", "next"]])`: Whether to include the delimiter with the preceding sentence (`"prev"`), the succeeding sentence (`"next"`), or not at all (`None`). Defaults to `"prev"`.

**Methods:**

- `chunk(text: str) -> list[SemanticChunk]`: Chunks a single string into a list of `SemanticChunk` objects.
- `chunk_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[SemanticChunk]]`: Chunks a list of strings. (Inherited)
- `from_recipe(name: str, lang: str, **kwargs) -> SemanticChunker`: Creates a `SemanticChunker` using pre-defined recipes (delimiters, etc.) from the [Chonkie Recipe Store](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chonkie-ai/recipes), simplifying setup for specific languages. Requires `chonkie[hub]`.
- `__call__(text: Union[str, list[str]]) -> Union[list[SemanticChunk], list[list[SemanticChunk]]]`: Convenience method calling `chunk` or `chunk_batch` depending on input type. (Inherited)

**Examples:**

Here are a couple of examples on how to use the `SemanticChunker` in practice.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Usage of `SemanticChunker`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[semantic]" or relevant embedding model extra (e.g., "chonkie[st]")
from chonkie import SemanticChunker

# Initialize with default settings (potion-base-8M model, auto threshold)
chunker = SemanticChunker()

text = "Semantic chunking groups related ideas. This sentence is related to the first. This one starts a new topic. Exploring different chunking strategies is key."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Print out the chunks (SemanticChunk objects)
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Text: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Token Count: {chunk.token_count}")
    print(f"Start Index: {chunk.start_index}")
    print(f"End Index: {chunk.end_index}")
    print(f"Number of Sentences: {len(chunk.sentences)}") # SemanticChunk specific attribute
    print("-" * 10)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Using `SemanticChunker` with a specific threshold and different model</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[semantic, st]" for sentence-transformers
from chonkie import SemanticChunker

# Use a different embedding model and a fixed percentile threshold
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2", # From sentence-transformers
    threshold=90, # Use 90th percentile for similarity threshold
    chunk_size=128
)

text = "Using a percentile threshold can adapt to document density. 90 means splits occur at lower similarity points. This can result in more, smaller chunks potentially. Let's test this."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n---")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Using `SemanticChunker.from_recipe`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[hub, semantic]" or relevant embedding model extra
from chonkie import SemanticChunker

# Uses default recipe for English ('en') delimiters
# Specify embedding model and other parameters as needed
chunker = SemanticChunker.from_recipe(
    lang="en",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2", # Example
    chunk_size=64,
    threshold="auto"
)

text = "Recipes simplify delimiter setup. Semantic logic remains. This is English text."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n---")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Visualizing the chunks with `Visualizer`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[viz, semantic]" or relevant embedding model extra
from chonkie import SemanticChunker, Visualizer

chunker = SemanticChunker(chunk_size=50)
text = "Visualization helps understand semantic breaks. See where the model decided to split the text based on meaning. This is useful for debugging."
chunks = chunker(text)

viz = Visualizer()
viz(chunks) # Prints colored output to terminal or creates HTML
```

</details>

### `SDPMChunker`

The `SDPMChunker` (Semantic Double-Pass Merging Chunker) builds upon the `SemanticChunker` by adding a second merging pass. After the initial semantic grouping of sentences, it attempts to merge nearby groups based on their semantic similarity, even if they are separated by a few other groups (controlled by the `skip_window` parameter). This can help capture broader semantic contexts that might be missed by only looking at immediately adjacent sentences or groups. It inherits most parameters and functionalities from `SemanticChunker`.

**Parameters:**

Inherits all parameters from `SemanticChunker` with the addition of:

- `skip_window (int)`: The number of groups to "skip" when checking for potential merges in the second pass. For example, with `skip_window=1`, the chunker compares group `i` with group `i+2`. Defaults to `1`.

**Methods:**

Inherits all methods from `SemanticChunker`, including:

- `chunk(text: str) -> Union[list[SemanticChunk], list[str]]`: Chunks a single string using the double-pass merging strategy.
- `chunk_batch(texts: list[str]) -> Union[list[list[SemanticChunk]], list[list[str]]]`: Chunks a list of strings. (Inherited)
- `from_recipe(name: str, lang: str, **kwargs) -> SDPMChunker`: Creates an `SDPMChunker` using pre-defined recipes. Requires `chonkie[hub]`.
- `__call__(text: Union[str, list[str]]) -> Union[list[SemanticChunk], list[str], list[list[SemanticChunk]], list[list[str]]]`: Convenience method. (Inherited)

**Examples:**

Here are a couple of examples on how to use the `SDPMChunker` in practice.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Usage of `SDPMChunker`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[semantic]" or relevant embedding model extra (e.g., "chonkie[st]")
from chonkie import SDPMChunker

# Initialize with default settings (potion-base-8M model, auto threshold, skip_window=1)
chunker = SDPMChunker()

text = "This is the first topic. It discusses semantic chunking. This is a related sentence. Now we switch to a second topic. This topic is about embeddings. We go back to the first topic now. Double-pass merging helps here."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Print out the chunks (SemanticChunk objects)
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"--- Chunk {i+1} ---")
    print(f"Text: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Token Count: {chunk.token_count}")
    print(f"Start Index: {chunk.start_index}")
    print(f"End Index: {chunk.end_index}")
    print(f"Number of Sentences: {len(chunk.sentences)}")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Using `SDPMChunker` with a larger `skip_window`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[semantic, st]" for sentence-transformers
from chonkie import SDPMChunker

# Use a larger skip window and a specific model
chunker = SDPMChunker(
    embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    chunk_size=128,
    skip_window=2 # Try merging groups i and i+3
)

text = "Topic A, sentence 1. Topic A, sentence 2. Topic B, sentence 1. Topic C, sentence 1. Topic A, sentence 3. Merging across B and C might occur."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n---")
```

</details>

### `LateChunker`

The `LateChunker` implements a chunking strategy based on "late interaction," similar to the logic used in ColBERT style models. It first chunks the text using the logic inherited from `RecursiveChunker` based on specified delimiters and `chunk_size`. Then, it calculates the mean embedding for the tokens within each generated chunk using a provided `sentence-transformers` model. The final output consists of `LateChunk` objects, each containing the chunk text, metadata, and its corresponding sentence embeddings (from mean-pooled token embeddings).

This chunker requires the `sentence-transformers` library. You can install it with `pip install "chonkie[st]"`.

**Parameters:**

- `embedding_model (Union[str, SentenceTransformerEmbeddings, Any])`: The sentence-transformers embedding model to use for generating token embeddings. Can be a string identifier (e.g., `"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`) or an instantiated `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` object. Defaults to `"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`. Requires `chonkie[st]`.
- `chunk_size (int)`: The target maximum number of tokens per chunk, used by the underlying `RecursiveChunker`. Defaults to `512`.
- `rules (RecursiveRules)`: The recursive splitting rules to use. Defaults to `RecursiveRules()`. Defines delimiters and priorities for splitting.
- `min_characters_per_chunk (int)`: The minimum number of characters required for a chunk to be considered valid. Defaults to `24`.
- `**kwargs (Any)`: Additional keyword arguments passed to the `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` constructor if `embedding_model` is provided as a string.

**Methods:**

- `chunk(text: str) -> list[LateChunk]`: Chunks a string into a list of `LateChunk` objects, each containing its text, indices, token count, and calculated embedding.
- `chunk_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[LateChunk]]`: Chunks a list of strings. (Inherited)
- `from_recipe(name: str, lang: str, **kwargs) -> LateChunker`: Creates a `LateChunker` instance using pre-defined recursive splitting rules (`RecursiveRules`) from the [Chonkie Recipe Store](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chonkie-ai/recipes). Allows customization of `embedding_model`, `chunk_size`, etc. Requires `chonkie[hub]`.
- `__call__(text: Union[str, list[str]]) -> Union[list[LateChunk], list[list[LateChunk]]]`: Convenience method calling `chunk` or `chunk_batch` depending on input type. (Inherited)

**Examples:**

Here are a couple of examples on how to use the `LateChunker` in practice.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Usage of `LateChunker`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[st]" to be installed

# Initialize with default settings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, chunk_size 512)
chunker = LateChunker()

text = "Late interaction models process queries and documents token by token. This chunker provides token-level embeddings for each chunk. It uses recursive splitting first."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Print out the chunks and their embedding shapes
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Text: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Token Count: {chunk.token_count}")
    print(f"Start Index: {chunk.start_index}")
    print(f"End Index: {chunk.end_index}")
    # Embedding is a numpy array
    print(f"Embedding Shape: {chunk.embedding.shape}")
    print("-" * 10)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Using `LateChunker.from_recipe` with a different model</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[st, hub]" to be installed
from chonkie import LateChunker

# Uses default recipe for English ('en') recursive rules
# Specify a different embedding model and chunk size
chunker = LateChunker.from_recipe(
    lang="en",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2", # Example different model
    chunk_size=128
)

text = "Using a recipe simplifies rule setup. We can still specify the embedding model. This is useful for different languages or text types."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}")
    print(f"Embedding Shape: {chunk.embedding.shape}\n---")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Passing `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` arguments via `**kwargs`</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[st]" to be installed
from chonkie import LateChunker

# Example: Pass arguments to the underlying SentenceTransformer model,
# like specifying the device.
chunker = LateChunker(
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    chunk_size=256,
    device="cpu" # Kwarg passed to SentenceTransformerEmbeddings -> SentenceTransformer
)

text = "Keyword arguments allow fine-tuning the embedding model initialization if needed."
chunks = chunker(text)

for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.text)
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n---")

```
</details>


## Refinery

The `Refinery` classes are used to refine and add additional context to the chunks, through various means.

### `OverlapRefinery`


### `EmbeddingRefinery`


## Chefs

The `Chef` classes are chonkie's pre-processing classes that are used to find, fetch, clean and process the data, preparing it to be chunked. Since Chonkie's chunkers are designed to be non-destructive in nature, the `Chef` classes consist of steps that involve non-reversible operations like conversion from HTML to text, or cleaning text from unwanted characters.




## Tokenizers

Fundamentally, chunking is a token-based operation. Chunking is done to load chunks into embedding models or LLMs, and limitations around size are often token-based. Chonkie supports a variety of tokenizers and tokenizer engines, through its `Tokenizer` class. 

The `Tokenizer` class is a wrapper that holds the `tokenizer` engine object and provides a unified interface to `encode`, `decode` and `count_tokens`.

**Available Tokenizers:**

- `character`: Character tokenizer that encodes characters. **This is the default tokenizer.**
- `word`: Word tokenizer that encodes words.
- `tokenizers`: Allows loading any tokenizer from the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library.
- `tiktoken`: Allows using the `tiktoken` tokenizer from OpenAI.
- `transformers`: Allows loading tokenizers from `AutoTokenizer` within the `transformers` library.

**Usage:**

You can initialize a `Tokenizer` object with a string that maps to the desired tokenizer.

```python
from chonkie import Tokenizer

# Uses character tokenizer by default
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
# Or explicitly specify:
tokenizer = Tokenizer("character")
# Or use a different tokenizer:
tokenizer = Tokenizer("gpt2")
```

You can also pass a `tokenizer` engine object to the `Tokenizer` constructor.

```python
from tiktoken import get_encoding
from chonkie import Tokenizer

# Get the tiktoken encoding for gpt2
encoding = get_encoding("gpt2")

# Initialize the Tokenizer with the encoding
tokenizer = Tokenizer(tokenizer=encoding)
```

**Methods:**

- `encode(text: str) -> list[int]`: Encodes a string into a list of tokens.
- `encode_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[int]]`: Encodes a list of strings into a list of lists of tokens.
- `decode(tokens: list[int]) -> str`: Decodes a list of tokens into a string.
- `decode_batch(tokens: list[list[int]]) -> list[str]`: Decodes a list of lists of tokens into a list of strings.
- `count_tokens(text: str) -> int`: Counts the number of tokens in a string.
- `count_tokens_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[int]`: Counts the number of tokens in a list of strings.

**Example:**

```python
from chonkie import Tokenizer

# Uses character tokenizer by default
tokenizer = Tokenizer()

tokens = tokenizer.encode("Hello, world!")
print(tokens)

decoded = tokenizer.decode(tokens)
print(decoded)

token_count = tokenizer.count_tokens("Hello, world!")
print(token_count)
```

## Embeddings

Chonkie has quite a few usecases for embeddings —— `SemanticChunker` uses them to embed sentences, `LateChunker` uses them to get token embeddings, and the `EmbeddingsRefinery` uses them to get embeddings for downstream upsertion into vector databases. Chonkie tries to support a variety of different embedding models, and providers so that it can be used by as many people as possible.

**Available Embedding Models:** Chonkie supports the following embedding models (with their aliases):

- `Model2VecEmbeddings` (`model2vec`): Uses the `Model2Vec` model to embed text.
- `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` (`sentence-transformers`): Uses a `SentenceTransformer` model to embed text.
- `OpenAIEmbeddings` (`openai`): Uses the OpenAI embedding API to embed text.
- `CohereEmbeddings` (`cohere`): Uses Cohere's embedding API to embed text.
- `GeminiEmbeddings` (`gemini`): Uses Google's Gemini embedding API to embed text.
- `JinaEmbeddings` (`jina`): Uses Jina's embedding API to embed text.
- `VoyageAIEmbeddings` (`voyageai`): Uses the Voyage AI embedding API to embed text.

Given that it has a bunch of different embedding models, it becomes challenging to keep track of which `Embeddings` class can load a given model. To make this easier, we built the `AutoEmbeddings` class. With `AutoEmbeddings`, you can pass a URI string of the model you want to load and it will return the appropriate `Embeddings` class. The URI usually takes the form of `alias://model_name` or `alias://provider/model_name`.

```python
from chonkie import AutoEmbeddings

# Since this model is registered with the Registry, we can use the string directly
embeddings = AutoEmbeddings.get_embedding("minishlab/potion-base-32M")

# If it's not registered, we can use the full URI with the provider name
embeddings = AutoEmbeddings.get_embedding("model2vec://minishlab/potion-base-32M")

# You can also load the same model with different providers as long as they support the same model
embeddings = AutoEmbeddings.get_embedding("st://minishlab/potion-base-32M")
```

If you're trying to load a model from a local path, it's recommended to use the `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` class. With the `AutoEmbeddings` class, you can pass in the `model` object initialized with the `SentenceTransformer` class as well, and it will return chonkie's `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` object. 

> [!NOTE]
> If `AutoEmbeddings` can't find a model, it will try to search the HuggingFace Hub for the model and load it with the `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` class. If that also fails, it will raise a `ValueError`.

**Methods:**

All `Embeddings` classes have the following methods:

- `embed(text: str) -> list[float]`: Embeds a string into a list of floats.
- `embed_batch(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]`: Embeds a list of strings into a list of lists of floats.
- `get_tokenizer_or_token_counter() -> Any`: Returns the tokenizer or token counter object.
- `__call__(text: Union[str, list[str]]) -> Union[list[float], list[list[float]]]`: Embeds a string or a list of strings into a list of floats.

**Example:**

```python
from chonkie import AutoEmbeddings

# Get the embeddings for a model
embeddings = AutoEmbeddings.get_embedding("minishlab/potion-base-32M")

# Embed a string
embedding = embeddings.embed("Hello, world!")

# Embed a list of strings
embeddings = embeddings.embed_batch(["Hello, world!", "Hello, world!"])
```

### Custom Embeddings

If you're trying to load a model that is not already supported by Chonkie, don't worry! We've got you covered. Just follow the steps below:

1. Check if your provider supports the OpenAI API. If it does, you can use the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class with the `base_url` parameter to point to your provider's API. You're all set!
2. If your provider does not support the OpenAI API, and you're loading a model locally, you can use the `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` class to load your model. You'll need to pass in the `model` object initialized with your model.
3. Lastly, you can create your own `Embeddings` class by inheriting from the `BaseEmbeddings` class and implementing the `embed`, `embed_batch`, and `get_tokenizer_or_token_counter` methods.

**Example:**

```python
from typing import List, Any
from chonkie import BaseEmbeddings

# Let's say we have a custom embedding model that we want to support
class MyEmbeddings(BaseEmbeddings):
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer):
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer

    def embed(self, text: str) -> list[float]:
        return self.model.embed(text)
    
    def embed_batch(self, texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
        return self.model.embed_batch(texts)
    
    def get_tokenizer_or_token_counter(self) -> Any:
        return self.tokenizer

    @property
    def dimension(self) -> int:
        return self.model.dimension

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(model={self.model}, tokenizer={self.tokenizer})"

```

Of course the above example is a bit contrived, but you get the idea. Once you're done, you can use the above `Embeddings` class with the `SemanticChunker` or `LateChunker` classes, and it will work as expected!


## Genies

Genies are Chonkie's interface for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). They can be integrated into advanced chunking strategies (like the `SlumberChunker`) or used for other LLM-powered tasks within your data processing pipeline. Genies handle the communication with different LLM providers, offering a consistent way to generate text or structured JSON output.

Currently, Chonkie provides Genies for Google's Gemini models and OpenAI's models (including compatible APIs).

### `GeminiGenie`

The `GeminiGenie` class provides an interface to interact with Google's Gemini models via the `google-genai` library.

Requires `pip install "chonkie[genie]"`.

**Parameters:**

- `model (str)`: The specific Gemini model to use. Defaults to `"gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25"`.
- `api_key (Optional[str])`: Your Google AI API key. If not provided, it will attempt to read from the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. Defaults to `None`.

**Methods:**

- `generate(prompt: str) -> str`: Sends the prompt to the specified Gemini model and returns the generated text response.
- `generate_json(prompt: str, schema: BaseModel) -> dict[str, Any]`: Sends the prompt and a Pydantic `BaseModel` schema to the Gemini model, requesting a JSON output that conforms to the schema. Returns the parsed JSON as a Python dictionary.

## Porters

Porters are responsible for exporting chunked data into various formats, often for saving to files or further processing outside of immediate database insertion.

### `JSONPorter`

The `JSONPorter` converts a list of `Chunk` objects into a JSON or JSON Lines (JSONL) format and saves it to a specified file. This is useful for storing chunked data locally or for interoperability with other systems that consume JSON data.

**Parameters:**

- `lines (bool)`: If `True`, exports the chunks in JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line). If `False`, exports as a single JSON array containing all chunk objects. Defaults to `True`.

**Methods:**

- `export(chunks: list[Chunk], file: str = "chunks.jsonl") -> None`: Converts the list of `Chunk` objects into the specified JSON format (`lines=True` for JSONL, `lines=False` for standard JSON array) and writes the output to the specified `file`. The default filename changes based on the `lines` parameter during initialization (`.jsonl` if `lines=True`, `.json` if `lines=False`).

**Examples:**

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Exporting Chunks to JSON Lines (Default)</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker, JSONPorter

# Sample Chunks
chunker = TokenChunker(chunk_size=50)
text = "This text will be chunked and exported to a JSON Lines file. Each chunk is a line."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Initialize porter (lines=True by default)
porter = JSONPorter()

# Export to chunks.jsonl
porter.export(chunks)

print("Chunks exported to chunks.jsonl")

# You can optionally specify a different filename:
# porter.export(chunks, file="my_chunks.jsonl")
```
*Output file (`chunks.jsonl`):*
```json
{"text": "This text will be chunked and exported to a JSON Lines file.", "token_count": 14, "start_index": 0, "end_index": 60}
{"text": "Each chunk is a line.", "token_count": 6, "start_index": 61, "end_index": 83}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Exporting Chunks to a Standard JSON Array</strong></summary>

```python
from chonkie import SentenceChunker, JSONPorter

# Sample Chunks
chunker = SentenceChunker(chunk_size=30)
text = "Exporting as a single JSON array. All chunks will be in one list. Set lines=False."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Initialize porter with lines=False
porter = JSONPorter(lines=False)

# Export to chunks.json (default filename when lines=False)
porter.export(chunks)

print("Chunks exported to chunks.json")

# Optionally specify a different filename:
# porter.export(chunks, file="my_chunks_array.json")
```
*Output file (`chunks.json`):*
```json
[
    {
        "text": "Exporting as a single JSON array.",
        "token_count": 8,
        "start_index": 0,
        "end_index": 32
    },
    {
        "text": "All chunks will be in one list.",
        "token_count": 8,
        "start_index": 33,
        "end_index": 64
    },
    {
        "text": "Set lines=False.",
        "token_count": 4,
        "start_index": 65,
        "end_index": 81
    }
]
```

</details>

## Handshakes

Handshakes are Chonkie's way of connecting your chunked data to downstream applications, particularly vector databases. They handle the final step of preparing and exporting `Chunk` objects, often involving embedding the chunk text and formatting the data according to the target database's requirements. Handshakes typically require specific database client libraries to be installed.

### `ChromaHandshake`

The `ChromaHandshake` facilitates exporting `Chunk` objects into a ChromaDB collection. It handles embedding the chunks using a specified model and upserting them into the target collection.

This handshake requires the `chromadb` library. You can install it with `pip install "chonkie[chroma]"`.

**Parameters:**

- `client (Optional[chromadb.Client])`: An existing ChromaDB client instance. If `None`, a new client will be created. If `path` is also `None`, an in-memory client is used; otherwise, a persistent client is created at the specified `path`.
- `collection_name (Union[str, Literal["random"]])`: The name of the ChromaDB collection to use. If `"random"`, a unique name will be generated. Defaults to `"random"`.
- `embedding_model (Union[str, BaseEmbeddings])`: The embedding model to use for generating chunk embeddings before upserting. Can be a string identifier (like `"minishlab/potion-retrieval-32M"`) resolved by `AutoEmbeddings` or an instantiated `BaseEmbeddings` object. Defaults to `"minishlab/potion-retrieval-32M"`.
- `path (Optional[str])`: The local filesystem path for a persistent ChromaDB client. If provided and `client` is `None`, a `PersistentClient` will be used. Defaults to `None`.

**Methods:**

- `write(chunks: Union[Chunk, Sequence[Chunk]]) -> None`: Embeds the provided chunk(s) using the specified `embedding_model` and upserts them into the target ChromaDB collection. It generates unique IDs for each chunk based on its content and index, and stores chunk metadata (start/end index, token count) alongside the text and embedding.

### `QdrantHandshake`

The `QdrantHandshake` exports `Chunk` objects to a Qdrant vector collection. It embeds the chunks and uploads them as points with associated payloads (metadata).

This handshake requires the `qdrant-client` library. You can install it with `pip install "chonkie[qdrant]"`.

**Parameters:**

- `client (Optional[qdrant_client.QdrantClient])`: An existing Qdrant client instance. If `None`, a new client is created based on `url`, `api_key`, or `path`. If all are `None`, an in-memory client (`:memory:`) is used.
- `collection_name (Union[str, Literal["random"]])`: The name of the Qdrant collection. If `"random"`, a unique name is generated. Defaults to `"random"`.
- `embedding_model (Union[str, BaseEmbeddings])`: The embedding model for generating chunk embeddings. Defaults to `"minishlab/potion-retrieval-32M"`.
- `url (Optional[str])`: The URL of the Qdrant server. Used if `client` is `None`.
- `api_key (Optional[str])`: API key for Qdrant Cloud. Used if `client` is `None` and `url` points to a cloud instance.
- `path (Optional[str])`: Path for a local Qdrant collection persistence. Used if `client` and `url` are `None`.
- `**kwargs (dict[str, Any])`: Additional arguments passed to the `qdrant_client.QdrantClient` constructor when a client is created internally.

**Methods:**

- `write(chunks: Union[Chunk, Sequence[Chunk]]) -> None`: Embeds the chunks and upserts them as `PointStruct` objects into the target Qdrant collection. Each point includes a vector (embedding), a payload (text, indices, token count), and a generated UUID.

**Examples:**

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Usage with In-Memory Qdrant</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[qdrant]" and an embedding model dependency (e.g., "chonkie[st]")
from chonkie import TokenChunker, QdrantHandshake

# Sample Chunks
chunker = TokenChunker(chunk_size=50)
text = "Sending these chunks to an in-memory Qdrant instance via the handshake. Quick and easy for testing."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Initialize handshake (will use :memory: Qdrant client)
handshake = QdrantHandshake(embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2") # Example model

# Write the chunks
handshake.write(chunks)

print(f"Chunks written to Qdrant collection: {handshake.collection_name}")
# Note: Data is lost when the script ends for in-memory instances.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Connecting to a Local Qdrant Instance</strong></summary>

```python
# Requires "chonkie[qdrant, st]"
# Assumes a local Qdrant server is running on default port 6333
from chonkie import SentenceChunker, QdrantHandshake

# Sample Chunks
chunker = SentenceChunker(chunk_size=40)
text = "Connecting to a running Qdrant server. Ensure it's accessible at the specified URL. This data will persist."
chunks = chunker(text)

# Initialize handshake to connect to local Qdrant
handshake = QdrantHandshake(
    collection_name="local_docs_collection",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    url="http://localhost:6333" # Default Qdrant URL
)

# Write the chunks
handshake.write(chunks)

print(f"Chunks written to Qdrant collection '{handshake.collection_name}' on server.")

# You could verify using a qdrant_client directly:
# import qdrant_client
# client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
# count = client.count(collection_name="local_docs_collection")
# print(f"Collection count: {count.count}")
```

- `namespace_name (Union[str, Literal["random"]])`: The name of the Turbopuffer namespace. If `"random"`, a unique name is generated. Defaults to `"random"`. Used only if `namespace` is `None`.
- `embedding_model (Union[str, BaseEmbeddings])`: The embedding model for generating chunk embeddings. Defaults to `"minishlab/potion-retrieval-32M"`.
- `api_key (Optional[str])`: Your Turbopuffer API key. If `None`, it attempts to read from the `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY` environment variable. Required.

**Methods:**

- `write(chunks: Union[Chunk, Sequence[Chunk]]) -> None`: Embeds the chunks and uploads them to the specified Turbopuffer namespace using the `upsert_columns` method. It includes generated IDs, embeddings, text, and metadata.
